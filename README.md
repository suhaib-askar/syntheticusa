## About SyntheticUSA

SyntheticUSA is  is a model of synthetic residents of the United States, with artificial health records for the fictional residents.  It builds on software developed for the [SyntheticMass](https://github.com/synthetichealth/syntheticmass) project to support a larger synthetic population and to provide novel visualization methods.

This project is currently early in the development phase, and all components in this repository are prototypes that are not yet stable.  These components currently include:

* [/site](/site): Prototype front-end dashboard to allow users to explore the synthetic population
* [/stream-server](/stream-server): Prototype real-time http stream service to display medical events in the synthetic population as they happen
