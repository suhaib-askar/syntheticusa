## fhir-to-csv.js

This Node.js script exports a directory of FHIR STU3 patient health records generated by
[Synthea](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea) into CSV format, suitable for import into data visualization tools, 
such as [MapD Immerse](https://mapd.com/platform/immerse). It was written to explore options for visualing large sets of
synthetic patient medical records.

## Usage

This script writes to stdout.  To save, redirect stdout into a file.

```bash

npm install 
node index.js /path/to/fhir/json/directory/ > out.csv

# add -s to supress the csv header, useful to append to an existing csv
node index.js -s -- /path/to/more/fhir/files >> out.csv

```

For simplicity, this script only exports one line per patient, with the following columns:

```javascript

var headers = [
  'NAME',
  'GENDER',
  'BIRTHDATE',
  'DEATHDATE',
  'AGE',
  'ALIVE',
  'CITY',
  'STATE',
  'LATITUDE',
  'LONGITUDE',
  'MARITAL_STATUS',
  'COMMUNICATION',
  'COMMUNICATION_COUNT',
  'RACE',
  'ETHNICITY',
  'AGE_AT_HEIGHT',
  'HEIGHT',
  'AGE_AT_WEIGHT',
  'WEIGHT',
  'CAUSE_OF_DEATH',
  'CONDITION_COUNT',
  'ACTIVE_CONDITION_COUNT',
  'ENCOUNTER_COUNT',
  'OBSERVATION_COUNT',
  'PROCEDURE_COUNT'
];

```
