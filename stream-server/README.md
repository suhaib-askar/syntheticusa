# Stream Server

Experimental synthetic medical record event streaming service for development purposes. This is implemented using [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and
is intended to be used as a mock streaming interface to facilitate front end development of SyntheticUSA.  This
implementation will be replaced with a more robust solution in the future once our SyntheticUSA models are complete.

## Local Installation

First, install local dependencies

```
npm install
```

Place JSON FHIR files generated by Synthea in /data. 

The prototype stream server will identify all events that have occured in these synthetic medical records, 
and will stream them out in random order using an [EventSource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource) 
interface at an adjustabe rate.

Start the development server

```
npm start
```

This will launch a Node.js HTTP server, listening on ```http://localhost:1337/events?eps=50```.  The ```eps``` parameter 
allows you to adjust the rate at which the server sends out random events.  This is useful for load testing on the front
end, before we have real synthetic data to use.
